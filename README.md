# ELG7100

A repository for the solutions written for assignments in ELG7100: The Moment Method for Engineering Electromagnetics. Accurate results not guaranteed.

The code contained in this repository is used primarily to simulate waveguide and lens geometries using the moment method (also known as the boundary element method or BEM), which relies heavily on the use of integral equation solutions using Green's functions to the problems presented.

There will be updates added (mostly comments to clarify the code) as soon as possible.
